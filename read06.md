# what is git?
- You use Git to take snapshots of your code at points in time
- Git keeps a history of what those snapshots look like
- Git has a special label, called HEAD, that means “You Are Here
- Usually you give a snapshot a label called a message
# what is github?
* A way to share code with others
* It uses Git to help you manage your team’s work
* An online place to store your code
# what is a repository?
- A repository is a collection of files that you’ve told Git to pay attention
# > git status:
- It will tell you what files have changed since your last commit.
Right now, git is paying attention to 1 file (README.md)
# > git add README.md:
-This tells git to include these changes in the next snapshot.
Think of it as placing items into a scene to photograph
# > git commit -m “Adds initial greeting to the world”:
-git commit is the shutter-button to take the snapshot
-m specifies the message included with the commit
Think of the message as being like a photo caption
