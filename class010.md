# what is the error handling?
- Errors, bugs, and therefore debugging are a part of life for a programmer. Error handling is
a combination of coding and methodology that allows your program to anticipate user and
other errors. ... It allows you to create a robust program.

# debugging?
Once you notice that there is something wrong with your program because it misbehaves or produces errors, the next step is to figure out what the problem is.

Sometimes it is obvious. The error message will point at a specific line of your program, and if you look at the error description and that line of code, you can often see the problem.

But not always. Sometimes the line that triggered the problem is simply the first place where a bogus value produced elsewhere gets used in an invalid way. And sometimes there is no error message at allâ€”just an invalid result.
# Did You Know?
Debugging is the process of testing, finding, and reducing bugs (errors) in computer programs.
The first known computer bug was a real bug (an insect) stuck in the electronics.
