# whats type of list in html ?
- Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is
numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for
a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract
where each point needs to be identified by a section
number.
- Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point
(rather than characters that indicate order).
