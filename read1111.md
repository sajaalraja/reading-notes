## What is OAuth?
- OAuth is an open-standard authorization protocol or framework that provides applications the ability for “secure designated access.” For example, you can tell Facebook that it’s OK for ESPN.com to access your profile or post updates to your timeline without having to give ESPN your Facebook password. This minimizes risk in a major way: In the event ESPN suffers a breach, your Facebook password remains safe.

## Give an example of what using OAuth would look like.?

- The simplest example of OAuth in action is one website saying “hey, do you want to log into our website with other website’s login?” In this scenario, the only thing the first website – let’s refer to that website as the consumer – wants to know is that the user is the same user on both websites and has logged in successfully to the service provider – which is the site the user initially logged into, not the consumer.

Facebook apps are a good OAuth use case example. 

## How does OAuth work? What are the steps that it takes to authenticate the user?
- The process is fairly simple; users input their credentials on the website's login form. That
information is then sent to the authentication server where the information is compared with
all the user credentials on file. When a match is found, the system will authenticate users
and grant them access to their accounts.

## What is OpenID?

- is for authentication, opposed to OAuth which is used for authorization.

## What is the difference between authorization and authentication?
- Authentication and authorization might sound similar, but they are distinct security processes in the world of identity and access management (IAM). Authentication confirms that users are who they say they are. Authorization gives those users permission to access a resource.
