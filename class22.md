#  chapter 2 text :
 When creating a web page, you add tags
(known as markup) to the contents of the
page. These tags provide extra meaning
and allow browsers to show users the
appropriate structure for the page.
## heading: 
- h1This is a Main Heading
- h2 This is a Level 2 Heading
- h3 This is a Level 3 Heading
- h4 This is a Level 4 Heading
- h5 This is a Level 5 Heading
- h6 This is a Level 6 Heading
## paragraph :
-  p
To create a paragraph, surround
the words that make up the
paragraph with an opening 
tag and closing  tag.
## bold and italic :

- b: By enclosing words in the tags
 and  we can make
characters appear bold.
- i
By enclosing words in the tags
we can make
characters appear italic.
- em
The em element indicates
emphasis that subtly changes
the meaning of a sentence.
By default browsers will show
the contents of an em element
# introducing to css  chapter 10:
## why using css?
CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of
an element should appear. For example, you can specify that
the background of the page is cream, all paragraphs should
appear in gray using the Arial typeface, or that all level one
headings should be in a blue, italic, Times typeface.
## example:
- h1, h2, h3 {
font-family: Arial;
color: yellow;}
- body {
font-family: arial;
background-color: rgb(185,179,175);}
h1 {
color: rgb(255,255,255);}
- CSS treats each HTML e XX lement as if it appears inside
its own box and uses rules to indicate how that
element should look.
- Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the
elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that
indicate what these elements should look like).
- Different types of selectors allow you to target your
rules at different elements.
- Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties
of the element that you want to change, and the values
of those properties. For example, the font-family
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial
specifies Arial as the preferred typeface
# javascript:
## why using javascript?
- responsible for dynamic and interactivr website.
## how do i write ascript for webpage?
- It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript 
file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and 
CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension. 
- The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages 
to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like 
the <link> element can be used to load a CSS file). 
- If you view the source code of the page in the browser, 
the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML, 
because the script works with the model of the web 
page that the browser has created.
# what is variable?
- A script will have to temporarily 
store the bits of information it 
needs to do its job. It can store this data

- Functions allow you to group a set of related 
statements together that represent a single task.
- An object is a series of variables and functions that 
represent something from the world around you.
