# layout css:
-  div elements are often used as containing elements
to group together sections of a page.

-  Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.

-  The float property moves content to the left or right
of the page and can be used to create multi-column
layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)

-  Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.

-  Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).

-  Grids help create professional and flexible designs.

-  CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.

-  You can include multiple CSS files in one page
