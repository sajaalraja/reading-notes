## What does SQL stand for?
- SQL (pronounced "ess-que-el") stands for Structured Query Language. SQL is used to communicate with a database. According to ANSI (American National Standards Institute), it is the standard language for relational database management systems.
## What is a realational database?
-  relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.
## What type of structure does a relational database work with?
- The relational model means that the logical data structures—the data tables, views, and ndexes—are separate from the physical storage structures. This separation means that database administrators can manage physical data storage without affecting access to that data as a logical structure.
## What is a ‘schema’
 - schema is a combination of rules that determine how data is added to a database. It can have different fields like id, name, description, etc. Each new entry will have values corresponding to the schema.

## What is a NoSQL database?
- When people use the term “NoSQL database”, they typically use it to refer to any non-relational database. Some say the term “NoSQL” stands for “non SQL” while others say it stands for “not only SQL.” Either way, most agree that NoSQL databases are databases that store data in a format other than relational tables.

A common misconception is that NoSQL databases or non-relational databases don’t store relationship data well. NoSQL databases can store relationship data—they just store it differently than relational databases do. In fact, when compared with SQL databases, many find modeling relationship data in NoSQL databases to be easier than in SQL databases, because related data doesn’t have to be split between tables.
