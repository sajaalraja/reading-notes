###### s a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

# example
- header

# This is an <h1> tag
## This is an <h2> tag
###### This is an <h6> tag


- lists
* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b
- images
