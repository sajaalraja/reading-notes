last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to be pop out, when the function returns.(first in first out)
## What causes a Stack Overflow?
- a function that repeat itself  and error
he most-common cause of stack overflow is excessively deep or infinite recursion, in which a function calls itself so many times that the space needed to store the variables and information associated with each call is more than can fit on the stack.
