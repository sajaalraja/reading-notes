gi# introduction how to computer work?
## what make acomputer?
- A computer is an electronic machine that processes informationâ€”in other words, an information processor.
- aking in information is called input, storing information is better known as memory (or storage), chewing information is also known as processing, and spitting out results is called output.
## circuit and logic?
- Computers often chain logic gates together, by taking the output from one gate and using itas the input to another gate. We call that a logic circuit. Circuits enables computers to do more complex operations than they could accomplish with just a single gate. A diagram where two inputs A and B go into an AND gate.
## cpu:
- the CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the brain of a computer and performs many of its main tasks. It processes data and delegates commands. The speed at which all programs and processes run depends on the CPU's performance capacity. The higher the performance of a CPU, the faster the PC will run.
## memory:
- Computer memory is divided into main (or primary) memory and auxiliary (or secondary)memory. Main memory holds instructions and data when a program is executing, while auxiliary memory holds data and programs not currently in use and provides long-term storage.
## difference between hardware and software?
- Computer hardware is any physical device used in or with your machine, whereas software is a collection of codes installed onto your computer's hard drive Word processing software uses the computer processor, memory, and hard drive to generate and save documents. In a computer, hardware is what makes a computer work.
